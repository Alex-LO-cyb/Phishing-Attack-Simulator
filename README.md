# Phishing Attack Simulator with Gophish

For a while now, phishing has been a common and effective way for attackers to gain access to sensitive information such as login credentials, financial records, and personal data. Anti-phishing technology solutions have gotten better over time, but phishing is a constant cat-and-mouse game between the attackers and defenders. And, as is the case with most aspects of enterprise security, humans tend to be the weakest link in the defence.

## Objective

This project involves deploying and configuring a phishing attack simulation environment using Gophish, an open-source framework for simulating targeted phishing attacks via email. The goal is to raise awareness about phishing threats by exposing users to realistic simulations. By launching phishing campaigns, I will be able to analyze user behavior and improve the security culture within the organization.

## Skills learned
- Ability to plan and manage a security awareness project from deployment to analysis.
- Hands-on experience with configuring and running phishing simulations.
- Improved understanding of social engineering tactics and user behavior.
- Familiarity with mail delivery mechanisms and SMTP configuration for phishing delivery.
- Proficiency in analyzing campaign metrics and drawing actionable insights.
- Awareness of compliance and data privacy considerations in simulated attacks.
